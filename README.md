Resx Localization in Xamarin Forms

A multilingual app is one that displays native language based on the Phone Culture
Almost all of my projects with Xamarin has been based on MVVMCross. With the new release of Xamarin 3, I am rather excited about the Shared UI but I always wondered about how to get my projects' UIs to be Xamarin Forms instead of MVVMCross binding.
So one of the issue I came across is Localization, as all of my apps are multilingual. With MVVMCross this is easy to be done using the Resx files. So I had a try with Xamarin Forms, it even more straightforward then I thought.
Resx is very simple and powerful, you can add or remove string, image, audio and video effortlessly. There is even a Multilingual Toolkit available from Microsoft to translate all existing string into a new Language using Bing Translate. Of course, you can further modify the translated results for your needs.
